. Middleware

Imagine you're at a restaurant, and you've placed an order for your favorite dish. Now,
before that dish reaches your table, it goes through several stages in the kitchen. Each
stage involves different tasks, like chopping vegetables, cooking, and adding spices.
Middleware is a bit like these stages in the kitchen-it's something that happens in
between your request and the final response in a web application.
Now, let's apply this idea to a web application, like the "Node Hotel" system:
1. Request Phase:
o You (the client) make a request to the Node Hotel system. It could be
asking for the menu, submitting a reservation, or anything else.
2. Middleware Phase:
o Middleware is like the behind-the-scenes process in the kitchen. It's a
series of functions that your request goes through before it reaches the
final destination.
3. Final Response Phase:
o After passing through the middleware, your request gets processed, and
the system sends back a response. It could be the menu you requested or
confirmation of your reservation.
-------------------------------------------------- 
Move on to the next phase                        |
// Middleware Function                           |
const logRequest = (req, res, next) => {         |
console.log( [${new Date().toLocaleString()}]    |
Request made to: ${req.originalUrl} );           |
next();                                          |
};                                               |
// Using Middleware in Express                   |
const express = require('express');              |
const app = express();                           |
// Apply Middleware to all Routes                |
app.use(logRequest);                             |
// Define Routes                                 |
app.get('/', (req, res) => {                     |
res.send('Welcome to Node Hotel!');              |
});                                              |
app.get('/menu', (req, res) => {                 |
res.send(Our delicious menu is coming right up!')|
});                                              |
// Start the Server                              |
const PORT = 3000;                               |
app.listen(PORT,() => {                          |
console.log('Server is running on                |
 http://localhost:${PORT});                      |
});                                              |
--------------------------------------------------

In this example, logRequest is our middleware. It logs the time and the requested
URL for every incoming request. The app. use(logRequest) line tells Express to
use this middleware for all routes.

So, when you access any route (like / or /menu), the middleware runs first, logs the
request, and then the route-specific code executes.
In summary, middleware is like a series of tasks that happen behind the scenes in a
web application. It's a way to add extra functionality to your application's
request-response cycle, such as logging, authentication checks, or modifying
request data, before it reaches its final destination.

Why do we use'the next() function in the middleware function

In Express.js, the next () function is a callback that signals to Express that the current
middleware function has completed its processing and that it's time to move on to the
next middleware function or route handler in the chain.

Imagine you're the manager of the "Node Hotel" application, and you want to ensure
that only authorized staff members can access certain features. This is where
authentication comes in.

1. Verifying Identity (Authentication):
. Scenario: When a staff member, let's say a chef, wants to log in to the Node
Hotel system, they need to prove that they are indeed the chef they claim to be.
. In Practice: In Node.js, authentication involves checking the chef's credentials,
like a username and password, to make sure they match what's on record. It's
like asking the chef to enter a secret code (password) and confirming that it's
correct.

2. Access Control (Authorization):

Now, let's add a layer of authorization based on the roles of the staff members.

. Scenario: Once the chef has proven their identity, you, as the manager, want to
control what they can and cannot do. For instance, chefs should be able to
update the menu items, but maybe not manage staff salaries.
· In Practice: In Node.js, after authenticating the chef, you'll use authorization to
decide what parts of the system they have access to. It's like giving the chef a
key card (authorization) that lets them into the kitchen but not into the manager's
office.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation in Node.js:

1. Authentication Middleware:
o In your Node.js application, you might use middleware like Passport to
handle the authentication process.
o Passport helps verify the identity of the chef based on their provided
credentials.
2. User Roles and Permissions:
o You'll define roles for staff members (e.g., chef, waiter, manager).
o Authorization middleware will check the role of the authenticated user and
grant access accordingly.

3. Secure Endpoints:
o You'll protect certain routes (like updating menu items) with authentication
checks.
o Only authenticated and authorized users (like chefs) will be allowed to
access these routes.

In the Hotel Context:

. Authentication: When Chef John logs in, the system checks if the provided
username and password match what's on record for Chef John.
. Authorization: Once authenticated, Chef John is authorized to modify menu
items but may not have permission to change other critical settings.

In simple terms, authentication in Node.js for your hotel application ensures that each
staff member is who they say they are, and authorization determines what they're
allowed to do once their identity is confirmed.

It's like having a secure system where only the right people get access to the right
areas of your hotel management application.

I

In general, authentication is applied before authorization in the security process.
Here's the typical sequence:
1. Authentication:
o The first step is to verify the identity of the user or system entity attempting
to access a resource or perform an action. This involves checking
credentials such as usernames and passwords or using other
authentication methods like tokens, API keys, or certificates.
2. Authorization:
o Once the identity is verified through authentication, the system moves on
to authorization. Authorization determines what actions or resources the
authenticated user or entity is allowed to access based on their
permissions, roles, or other access control mechanisms.

The reason for this order is straightforward: before you can determine what someone
is allowed to do (authorization), you need to know who they are (authentication).
Authentication establishes the identity, and authorization defines the permissions
associated with that identity.

In the context of web applications, middleware for authentication is typically applied
first in the request-response cycle to verify the user's identity. If authentication is
successful, the request proceeds to authorization middleware to determine what the
authenticated user is allowed to do.

It's important to note that while authentication and authorization are often discussed as
distinct steps, they work together as essential components of a security strategy to
control access to resources and protect agalnst unauthorized actions.

. Now we will implement Authentication as a middleware Function. So that,
Routes will be authenticated before reaching out to the server.
. Implementing authentication as a middleware function is a common and effective
approach.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· Passport.js

Passport.js is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js. Authentication is the
process of verifying the identity of a user, typically through a username and password,
before granting access to certain resources or features on a website or application.

Think of Passport.js as a helpful tool that makes it easier for developers to handle user
authentication in their Node.js applications. It simplifies the process of authenticating
users by providing a set of pre-built strategies for different authentication methods,
such as username and password, social media logins (like Facebook or Google), and
more.

Here's a breakdown of some key concepts in Passport.js:

1. Middleware: In the context of web development, middleware is software that sits
between the application and the server. Passport.js acts as middleware,
intercepting requests and adding authentication-related functionality to them.

2. Strategy: Passport.js uses the concept of strategies for handling different
authentication methods. A strategy is a way of authenticating users. Passport.js
comes with various built-in strategies, and you can also create custom strategies
to support specific authentication providers.

3. Serialize and Deserialize: Passport.js provides methods for serializing and
deserializing user data. Serialization is the process of converting user data into a
format that can be stored, usually as a unique identifier. Deserialization is the
reverse process of converting that unique identifier back into user data. These
process are essential for managing our process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Install Passport

To use Passport.js in a Node.js application, you need to install the passport package
along with the authentication strategies you intend to use.
For this course, we are using Local strategies authentication (username and
password).

you would typically install passport-local

npm install passport passport-local

Once you've installed these packages, you can set up and configure Passport.js in
your application.
-------------------------------------------------------------
const express = require('express');                         | 
const passport = require('passport');                       |
const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;   |
const app = express();                                      |
// Initialize Passport                                      |
app.use(passport.initialize());                             |
-------------------------------------------------------------

. Passport Local Strategy


. The Passport Local Strategy is a part of the Passport.js authentication
middleware for Node.js. It's specifically designed for handling username and
password-based authentication.
. The Passport Local Strategy, by default, expects to extract the username and
password from the request body. It is a common practice for username and
password-based authentication systems to send the credentials as part of the
request body, especially in login forms.

. Configure the Local Strategy

. Define and configure the Local Strategy using passport-local.
. You need to provide a verification function that checks the provided username
and password.
--------------------------------------------
passport.use(new LocalStrategy(            |
async (username, password, done) => {      | 
// Your authentication logic here          |
} I                                        |
));                                        |
--------------------------------------------    
. In the Local Strategy's verification function, you typically query your database to
find the user with the provided username. You then compare the provided
password with the stored password.
. In the context of LocalStrategy, Passport.js expects the verification function
to have the following signature:
function (username, password, done)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
passport.use(new LocalStrategy(async (username, password, done) => {      |
try {                                                                     |
console.log('Received credentials:', username, password);                 |
const user = await Person.findOne({ username });                          |
if (!user)                                                                |
return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username.' });             |
const isPasswordMatch = (user.password === password ? true : false);      |
if (isPasswordMatch)                                                      |
return done(null, user);                                                  |
else                                                                      |
return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect password.' })              |
} catch (error) {                                                         |
return done(error);                                                       |
}                                                                         |
}));                                                                      |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
. In the context of Passport.js, done is a callback function that is provided by
Passport to signal the completion of an authentication attempt. It is used to
indicate whether the authentication was successful, and if so, to provide
information about the authenticated user.
. The done function takes three parameters: done(error, user, info).
. If the authentication is successful, you call done(null, user) where user is
an object representing the authenticated user.
. If the authentication fails, you call done(null, false, { message: 'some
message' }). The second parameter (false) indicates that authentication
failed, and the third parameter is an optional info object that can be used to
provide additional details about the failure.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Store Plain Password

. Storing plain passwords is not a secure practice. To enhance security, it's highly
recommended to hash and salt passwords before storing them.

. You can use the bcrypt library for password hashing in your Node.js
application.
---------------------
npm install bcrypt  |
---------------------
User Password --> Salt ---->Hashing Algorithm ====>Hashed Password + Salt

. Now we have to update our person model to store hashed passwords. Modify
the registration logic to hash the password before saving it to the database.
. Because the end user didn't know about hashing, we have to internally maintain
it. Like we are saving the hashed password before saving it into the database
. We are using a Mongoose middleware hook to perform an action before saving a
document to the database. Specifically, it's using the pre middleware to execute
a function before the save operation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
//For bcrypt hasing                                                     |
personSchema.pre('save',async function(next){                           |         
    const person= this;                                                 |
    //Hash the password only if it is modified or its a new record      |
    if(!person.isModified('password')) return next();                   |
    try{                                                                |
        //Hash password generation                                      |
        const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);                          |
        //hash password                                                 |
        const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(person.password,salt); |
        //Overwrite the plain password with the hassed one              |
        person.password = hashedPassword;                               |
        next();                                                         |
    }catch(err){                                                        |
        return next(err);                                               |
    }                                                                   |
})                                                                      |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
. The pre('save', ... ) middleware is triggered before the save operation on
a Mongoose model instance.
. Inside the middleware function, it checks if the password field has been modified
(or if it's a new document). If not, it skips the hashing process.
. If the password has been modified, it generates a new salt using
bcrypt. genSalt and then hashes the password using bcrypt.hash.
. The original plain text password in the person document is then replaced with
the hashed password.
. The next () function is called to proceed with the save operation.

. The line const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10); is responsible for
generating a salt, which is a random string of characters used as an additional
input to the password hashing function. Salting is a crucial step in password
hashing to prevent attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to
quickly look up the hash value of a password.

. bcrypt.genSalt(rounds): This function generates a salt using the specified
number of "rounds." The rounds parameter indicates the complexity of the
hashing algorithm. The higher the number of rounds, the more secure the salt,
but it also increases the computational cost.
----------------------------------------------------------
if (!person.isModified('password')) return next();       |
----------------------------------------------------------
This line is a conditional check that prevents unnecessary rehashing of the password
when the document is being saved.

. person.isModified('password'): This method is provided by Mongoose
and returns true if the specified field ('password' in this case) has been
modified. It returns false if the field hasn't been modified.
. return next() ;: If the password field has not been modified, the function
immediately returns, skipping the rest of the middleware. This is because there's
no need to rehash the password if it hasn't changed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. How bcrypt works

When you use berypt to hash a password, the library internally stores the salt as part
of the resulting hashed password. This means that you don't need to separately store
the salt in your database; it is included in the hashed password itself.

Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. Hashing a Password:

When you hash a password using bcrypt. hash, the library generates a random salt,
hashes the password along with the salt, and produces a hashed password that
incorporates both the salt and the hashed value.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
const salt= await bcrypt.genSalt(10);                              |
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash('userPassword', salt);    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The hashedPassword now contains both the hashed password and the salt.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Modify Auth code

We have to also modify the password-matching logic in the passport auth file.
. Let's create a comparePassword named function which compares or check the
password.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
passport.use(new LocalStrategy(async (username, password, done) => {             |
try {                                                                            |
console. log('Received credentials:', username, passibrd);                       |
const user = await Person.findOne({ username });                                 |
if (!user)                                                                       |
return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username.'});                     |
const isPasswordMatch = await user.comparePassword(password, user.password);     |
if (isPasswordMatch)                                                             |
return done(null, user);                                                         |
else                                                                             |
return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect password.' })                     |
} catch (error) {                                                                |
return done(error);                                                              |
}                                                                                |
}));                                                                             |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Compare function

We also have to write the compare function
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Define the comparePassword method                                          |
personSchema. methods. comparePassword = async function(candidatePassword) {  |
try {                                                                         |
// Use bcrypt to compare the provided password with the hashed password       |
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, this.password);       |
return isMatch;                                                               |
} catch (error) {                                                             |
throw error;                                                                  |
}                                                                             |
}                                                                             |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verifying a Password

When you later want to verify a user's entered password during login, you use
bcrypt. compare. This function internally extracts the salt from the stored hashed
password and uses it to hash the entered password for comparison.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare('enteredPassword', storedHashedPassword);   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The compare function automatically extracts the salt from storedHashedPassword
and uses it to hash the entered password. It then compares the resulting hash with the
stored hash. If they match, it indicates that the entered password is correct.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Let us suppouse the password is
//shivam  ---> jvhjghuhliscjiljdckjdil
//While login we used
//login ----> lodh
//Then
//jvhjghuhliscjiljdckjdil ---> It will extract salt from it
//salt +  lodh ---->aadswddwdsxpodpwxwodj

//jvhjghuhliscjiljdckjdil !== aadswddwdsxpodpwxwodj(login failed)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
